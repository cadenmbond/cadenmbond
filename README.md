## Background

I began programming at age 10 with Hour of Code and Roblox scripting using Luau. This experience sparked my interest in software development. Since then, I have expanded my knowledge to include Python, Web Development, C++, and Java, and have continued formal study through high school computer science courses and creating projects in my freetime. My primary focus is C++.
