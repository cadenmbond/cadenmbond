## 📍 Background

I began programming at age 11 with Roblox scripting using Luau. This experience sparked my interest in software engineering. Since then, I have expanded my knowledge to include Python, web technologies, C++, and Java, and have continued formal study through high school computer science courses. My primary focus is C++.

I have a strong interest in performance-oriented development, graphics, and low-level problem solving.
