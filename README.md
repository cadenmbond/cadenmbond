## 🌱 Where did my journey begin

My first introduction into programming was when I was 12, playing games on the online platform Roblox. I began to wonder how games were made, and that's when I came across Roblox's building tool. This eventually evolved into my first introduction to programming using Lua. From there, I slowly branched off into learning new languages and expanding my knowledge. I also began taking computer classes at my school, further immersing me in the culture around computers and programming.
