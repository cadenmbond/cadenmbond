## 🌱 Where did my journey begin

My introduction to programming began at the age of 12 while playing games on the online platform Roblox. Curious about game development, I explored Roblox's built-in building tools, which eventually led me to scripting with Lua. This initial experience sparked my interest in programming, motivating me to explore additional languages and broaden my technical skills. As I continued to develop my knowledge, I later began enrolling in computer science courses at school, further deepening my understanding of programming concepts and the broader field of software development.
